# Verkle Tree Implementation for Verifiable Credentials

This repository contains a simplified implementation of Verkle Trees for verifiable credentials. It uses elliptic curve cryptography to create succinct proofs that specific credentials are part of a larger credential set (like a diploma).

## Installation

```bash
npm install elliptic bn.js crypto
```

## Overview

Verkle Trees improve on Merkle Trees by using polynomial commitments to reduce proof size. This implementation demonstrates their use for educational credentials verification:

- A diploma can contain multiple micro-credentials
- Anyone can verify a specific credential belongs to the diploma without seeing all credentials
- Proofs are compact and efficient

## Technical Background

### Key Components

1. **KZG Polynomial Commitments**:

   - Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg commitments based on elliptic curve pairings
   - Allows committing to a polynomial with constant-sized proofs

2. **Elliptic Curve Cryptography**:

   - Uses the secp256k1 curve (same as Bitcoin)
   - Provides the mathematical foundation for the commitment scheme

3. **Verkle Tree Structure**:
   - More efficient than Merkle Trees for multiple entries
   - Reduces proof size logarithmically

## Usage

### Creating a Verkle Tree for a Diploma

```javascript
const diploma = "12345_BachelorOfComputerScience";
const credentials = ["CS101", "CS102", "IT211", "IT212"];
const root = buildVerkleTree(diploma, credentials);
```

### Generating a Proof for a Credential

```javascript
const index = 0; // Index of the credential to prove
const proof = generateProof(root, index);
```

### Verifying a Credential Proof

```javascript
const isValid = verifyProof(root.commitment, proof, root.kzg);
console.log("Credential proof is valid:", isValid);
```

## Limitations

This implementation is simplified and has several limitations:

1. It uses elliptic.js rather than pairing-friendly curves (like BN254)
2. The verification is approximated without true pairing operations
3. It's meant for educational purposes, not production use

## Full Production Implementation

For a production-ready implementation, consider:

1. Using a pairing-friendly curve library like:

   - [mcl-wasm](https://github.com/herumi/mcl-wasm) - Efficient WebAssembly implementation
   - [noble-bls12-381](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-bls12-381) - Pure JavaScript BLS curves

2. Implementing proper bilinear pairings for verification

3. Adding proper error handling and input validation

## Security Considerations

When implementing this for production:

1. Ensure secure random number generation for the trusted setup
2. Consider using a multi-party computation for the trusted setup
3. Implement proper security measures for key management
4. Add proper exception handling for invalid inputs
